A simple tool for converting a given date to the Coligny Calendar, also known as the Celtic year. (https://www.maryjones.us/jce/coligny.html)

In order for this to work despite our limited understanding of the Celtic calendar, certain assumptions must be made. Because I am not very bright, the assumptions are the same as those laid out by  Segomâros Widugeni of Polytheist.com whose reasoning can be found at the following link: http://polytheist.com/segomaros/2016/07/12/the-coligny-calendar/

In short:
We assume that the first lunar cycle, Samonios, takes place near what the Gregorian Calendar would deem to be November.
We assume that the month begins on a New Moon.
Our starting year is 1019 BCE or -1019 CE.

The following additional assumptions have been made:
We are calculating the current lunar phases from Stonehenge, utilizing the coordinates 51.1789° N, 1.8262° W
There is no justification for this decision, save that it feels right.
All calculations are made once the moon has reached its peak.
There is no justification for this decision, save that it feels right.

The chosen starting date for the Coligny calendar as used in these calculations is
The reason for this decision is outlined in the comments at the start of year0calc.py
